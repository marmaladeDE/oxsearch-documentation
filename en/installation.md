1. Download the zip file of OXSEARCH.  
2. Install its contents to the path <ShopRoot>/modules/marm/oxsearch.  
3. Please make sure that the file <ShopRoot>/modules/marm/vendormetadata.php exists. If that's not the file, please create an empty file by that name.  
4. Now you can activate the extension in the OXID backend in Extensions > Modules > marmalade:: OXSEARCH.
