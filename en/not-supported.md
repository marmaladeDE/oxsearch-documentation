# Support of OXID standard functions #

As OXSEARCH is based on OXID, it supports most of the OXID standard functions. However, there are a few functions not supported:  

- user roles and rights in the frontend  
- Varnish from the high-performance option
- next and previous product on details page

However, unsupported OXID features can be adapted for specific projects. Don't hesitate to ask for a proposal.
