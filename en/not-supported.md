# Support of OXID standard functions #

As OXSEARCH is based on OXID, it supports most of the OXID standard functions. However, there are a few functions not supported:  

- user roles and rights in the frontend  
- Varnish from the high-performance option

However, unsupported OXID features can be adapted for specific projects.
